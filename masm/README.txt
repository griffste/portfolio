Description: This program exhibits a basic understanding of assembly language (masm) including functions, macros, and handling input/output.

The program does the following:
1) Generates and displays random combinatorics problems in the range n = [3...12] and r in [1...n]
2) Prompts user for answer, which is read in as a string, then validated and converted to an int
3) Recursively solves the problem
4) Tells the user if they were right or wrong
5) Asks user if they would like another problem or would like to quit
